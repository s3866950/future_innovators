        <h3>Personality Types</h3>
        <p>Among our group we have a variety of personality types, and with the information available we have been able to ascertain how we can operate as an effective team.</p>
        <p>We have leader types to propel the group forward and keep communication open, a support type to offer assistance to group members who may be struggling and keep us on track, an assertive logistician type to create and maintain a direct plan of action, and a virtuoso type who will be willing to explore ideas and concepts others may not be so quick to identify.</p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>
        <p>We have a variety of different learning styles in our team. This will be extremely beneficial in the sense that we will be able to assist each other on topics of study. If somebody in the team is unable to grasp a concept due to the manner in which it is presented, the chance of others being able to explain it is far greater than if we all possessed the same learning style.</p>

        <h3>Individual Tests</h3>
        <p>The separate tests undertaken provide good insight into what we each can bring to the team outside of the standard learning conventions. Whether it be high situational awareness or openness to delve into all aspects of working as a team, they show that we can each offer a unique trait to this group environment.</p>

        <p>Within our team, we have a broad scope of ideal jobs within the IT industry. Our job titles and roles are very different from one another, with the exception of Felipe and Jake.</p>

        <p>The direct differences of these roles are evident within the job title, with the likes of data, web development, software engineering, and support; however, their uses have several overlapping qualities.</p>

        <p>As different as  our roles are, they still have similar skillsets, both technical and general, which shows how broad and adaptive the IT industry can be. They all contain a base knowledge of software and programming and require good communication and problem-solving skills. The differences however, are in how these skills are utilised in the specific roles.</p>

    <div class="wrap">
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Upon creating our group, for this and future assignments, we opened a discussion thread on Canvas about the best and most effective ways to move forward with communication. We all came to an agreement that Microsoft Teams was the ideal choice of software as our primary method of communication. The ease of communicating ideas via text, video, and calls on desktop or mobile would be very straightforward, and we would also have the means to share and edit files.</p>

        <h3>Tools used for this assignment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Canvas</b> â€“ We mainly utilised Canvas as a source for preliminary discussions, but as we progressed with the assignment we began using it more to make announcements as it was a more direct, visible way of voicing something urgent for those that hadnâ€™t been checking Teams.</li>
            <li><b>MS Teams</b> â€“ Microsoft Teams was our primary communication tool throughout this assignment. We were able to communicate and share files/input on the message boards that we created and began to develop good working relationships with those who utilised the tool properly. We also held team video calls where we were able to more comprehensively communicate points and ideas, a benefit that messaging does not provide.</li>
            <li><b>Trello</b> â€“ The group did not start using Trello until a couple of weeks into the assignment, however when we realised how good of a tool it was for organising, uploading and viewing the assignment content it became an extremely useful asset. It provided us with a more in-depth scheduling device and a better visual representation of what needed to be accomplished.</li>
            <li><b>GitHub</b> â€“ GitHub was a very useful tool to be able to visually identify who was contributing content and who was not. Although we did utilise Trello as a place to upload our files, we continued accessing GitHub as we were still unaware of any problems we may encounter using a new system. In a way it was a good backup for us should any of our content have been misplaced or lost throughout the assignment process.</li>
        </ul>


        
        <p><b>Team Git Repository:</b> <a class="git-link" href="https://github.com/shaggy982/rmitita2g9" target="_blank">https://github.com/shaggy982/rmitita2g9</a></p>
    </div>

<section class="tools-2 block">
    <div class="wrap">
        <p>As is always the case with GitHub, the version control aspect of it is extremely useful, although we did not need to make use of it this time around.</p>
        <p>Although the GitHub repository was utilised to organise and upload files and information, the audit only vaguely reflects the work that was done. As it was used as a storage and organisational tool, it does not completely reflect the discourse and file sharing that took part during this project.</p>
        <p>Our ability to employ the benefits of other tools such as Teams and Trello made the use of, and reliance on, the GitHub repository minimal. Those contributing to the assignment did make use of it; however, the contribution levels merely show the content added and do not reflect the exchange of ideas about said content.</p>
